# Easy copy URL without trackers

Adds a little button to summarize articles, news, and similar content using the OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini model). The button only appears on pages detected as articles or news.

> Beware, on the first run the script will ask for an API key, you can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

> The model used is `gpt-4o-mini`, which is a cheap model, but it's not as good as `gpt-4o` , but it's great for most cases.
