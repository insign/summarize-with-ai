# Summarize with AI (OpenAI/Gemini)

- Adds a little button to summarize articles, news, and similar content.
- Uses the OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini model because it is fast and cheap)
- Or Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash-exp model because it is fast, cheap and powerful)
- The buttons only appear on pages detected as articles or news.
- Asks for an OpenAI/Gemini API key on first use.
- The summary is displayed in the user language independently of the original article.
